# Gencert
This is perhaps the worst way in the world to practise golang. Il s'agit d'un générateur de certificat.

## Way to use it
First you need to install go and gofpdf : 
```go get github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf```
## Note
In fact, the programme is far from finished. I need to generate certificates in html format and work on the way the data is entered. This project is part of my Golang apprenticeship.
